\section{Basic transformations of time series}

\vskip1cm

The goal of each transformation is to make time series stationary (or to appear to be stationary).
Why is stationrity important? If the distrubution is changing it is hard to predict anything.


\begin{example} (log/relative returns)
$S_t =$ financial data
$(S_t) \rightarrow (X_t), X_t = \log{S_t/S_{t-1}} $
$ \rightarrow (X_t'), X_t' = \frac{S_t - S_{t-1}}{S_{t-1}}$
\end{example}

We define the {\bf backwards shift} operator 
$B(X)_t = (BX)_t = X_{t-1}, t \in \Z$.

Notice that it maps $(X_t)_t$ into $(X_{t-1})_t$.

% on pi≈°e grad, govori pa delta...
We also define the {\bf differencing} operator $\nabla(X)_t = \nabla X_t = (I - B) X_t = X_t - X_{t-1}$. In other words
$\nabla = I - B$.

Recursively for $j \geq 1$ we difine $B^j X_t = B (B^{j-1} X_t)$ and the same for $\nabla$.

Note that $\nabla^0 = B^0 = I$. 

\begin{example}
Assume $(Y_t)$ is strictly stationary and $a,b \in \R, X_t = a t + b + Y_t$, then $X_t$ cannot be stationary unless $a = 0$. (homework ... use charasteristic functions)

But 
$\nabla X_t = at + b + Y_t - a(t-1) - b - Y_{t-1} = a + Y_t - Y_{t-1}$ is stationary ($Y_t$ and $Y_{t-1}$ have the same distribution).  
\end{example}


\begin{excercise}
Assume $(Y_t)$ is weakly stationary in the previous example. Show that $(X_t)$ is weakly stationary as well.

(hint: use lemma below)
\end{excercise}

\begin{excercise}
Show 
$\nabla^2 X_t = X_t - 2X_{t-1} + X_{t-2}$ for all $t$ and use that to determine a general form of $\nabla^k, k \geq 1$.
\end{excercise}


\begin{excercise}
Assume $(Y_t)$ is weakly (strongly) stationary. Assume $n_j = \sum_{j=0}^k a_j t^j$ and $X_t = n_t + Y_t$.

Then 
$\nabla^k X_t = k! a_k + \nabla^k Y_t$, which is again weakly (strongly) stationary.  
\end{excercise}

\begin{observation}
Differencing can remove any polynomial trend. 
\end{observation}


Assume that time series $(Y_t)$ satisfies 
$Y_t = \sum_{k = -\infty}^\infty h_k X_{t-k}, t \in \Z$ (assume it converges) for some sequence $h_k$ and some time series $(Y_t)$. Than we say that $(Y_t)$ is a product of action of {\bf  liner filter} of the sequence $(X_t)$.  

Formally we denote {\bf the filter } by $\Phi(B) =  \sum_{k = -\infty}^\infty h_k B^k$.

\begin{example}
$\nabla = B^0 - B^1$, so $h_0 = 1, h_1 = -1$ and $0$ otherwise.

\end{example}

If $(h_k)$ is absoultely summable and $(X_t)$ is a time series, which satifies $X_t = \sum h_k Z_{t-k}$ for $Z_t$ white noise we say $(X_t)$ is a {\bf liner process}. 

So linear process is an absoultely summable linear filter acting on white noise. 



\begin{example}(MA(1))
$X_t = Z_t + v Z_{t-1}$, $Z_t$ white noise.
\end{example}


The condition of absolute summability ensures $X_t$ is well defined (the sum converges).

\begin{lema} (key lemma on linear transformations)
Assume $(Z_t)_t$ is a time series and the sequence $(h_k)_k$ satisfies the absolute summability condition. Then 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\sup_t{E|Z-t|} < \infty \Rightarrow  \sum_k h_k Z_{t-k}$ converges absolutely a.s. and in $L_1$. 
\item $\sup_t{E Z_t^2} < \infty \Rightarrow \sum_k h_k Z_{t-k}$ converges in $L_2$ as well.
\item $Z_t$ weakly stationary $\Rightarrow$ the series $X_t = \sum_k h_k Z_{t-k}$ is weakly stationary as well. Moreover $\gamma_X(k) = \sum_{i,j} h_i h_{j + i - k} \gamma_Z(i)$.
\end{enumerate}

\end{lema}


Reminder:
$Y_n \rightarrow (L_p) Y$ means $E|Y_n - Y|^p \rightarrow 0$. 


\begin{excercise}
Assume $(X_t)$ satisfies $X_t \geq 0$ for all $t$. Then $E\sum_t X_t = \sum_t E X_t$ (can be $+ \infty$).

(hint: lebesbue theorem on monotone convergence)
% $\sum_{|t| \leq m} \convergesUp \sum_t X_t$
\end{excercise}

\begin{excercise}
Assume $\sum_t E|X_t| < \infty$. Then $\sum_t X_t$ converges a.s. and in $L_1$. Moreover $E\sum_t X_t = \sum_t E X_t$.

(hint: again lebesgue, but on dominat convergence)
\end{excercise}

\proof (of lema)
\begin{enumerate}
\item Observe $\sum_k E|h_k Z_{t-k}| \leq \sup_t E|Z_t|\sum_k |h_k|$. Now the previous excercise proves the series converges (everithing $< \infty$). 
\item If $\sup_t E Z_t^2 < \infty$ than the same goes for first moments (for example Cauchy-Schwartz). Also $|z| \leq 1 + z^2$. Now the series is converging, acording to (1). 
\item Consider the $E(\sum_j h_j Z_{t-j} - \sum_{|j|\leq k} h_j Z_{t-j})^2 =$

$ E(\sum_{|j| > k} h_j Z_{t-j})^2  \leq E(\sum_{|j| > k} |h_j| |Z_{t-j}|)^2 =$

$ \sum_{ |i|,|j| > k} |h_i||h_j| E(|Z_{t-i}||Z_{t-j}|)\leq$

($E(|Z_{t-i}||Z_{t-j}|) \leq \sqrt{E|Z_{t-i}|^2 E|Z_{t-j}|^2} \leq \sup_t E Z_t^2$.)

$\leq  \sup_t E Z_t^2 (\sum_{|i| > k} |h_i|)^2$

Because the $h_k$ converges all together moves to $0$ as $k \rightarrow \infty$. Now we again use (1) to see $X_t$ is well defined and the series converges a.a. and in $L_1$. Just use the previous excercise.

$E(\sum_j h_j Z_{t-j}) = \sum_j E(h_j Z{t-j}) = \sum_j h_j E(Z{t-j}) = \mu_Z \sum_j h_j$.

We can assume $\mu_Z = 0$ (otherwise we just substract it from the series and solve it for that series). It follows $EX_t = 0$ and 

$Cov(X_{t+h}, X_t) = E X_{t+h}X_t = E \sum_{i,j}h_i Z_{t+h-i}h_j Z_{t-j} = $

$= (excercise) \sum_{i,j} h_i h_j E(Z_{t+h-i} Z_{t-j})$

($E(Z_{t+h-i} Z_{t-j}) = \gamma_Z(h-i+j) \rightarrow 0$ (Cauchy-Schwatz or $|\gamma_Z(h)| \leq \gamma_Z(0)$).)

($l = h - i + j$)

$= \sum_{i,l}h_i h_{i+l-h} \gamma_Z(l) = \gamma_X(h)$. This does not depend on $t$!!  
\end{enumerate}
\endproof


\begin{excercise}
If $Z_t \tilde WN(0, \sigma^2 )$. For convergence of series $\sum_k h_k Z_{t-k}$ it is sufficent that $\sum h_j^2 < \infty$.

(hint: Use Hilber space theory to prove it)
\end{excercise}

Linear filter $\Psi(B) = \sum_k h_k B^k$ is {\bf causal} if $h_k = 0$ for $k < 0$. 

A linear process $X_t = \sum:k h_k Z_{t-k}$ is {\bf causal} (with respect to white npoise $(Z_k)$) if $h_k = 0$ for $k < 0$. 

\begin{example}
For $|\phi| < 1$ $(Z_t) \tilde WN(0,1)$ the series $X_t = \sum_{j=0}^\infty \phi^j Z_{t-j}$ is well defined and solves the AR(1) equation. Moreover $(X_t)$ is causal. 
\end{example}

Assume 
$\Psi(B) = \sum_j \psi_j B^j, \Phi(B) = \sum_j \phi_j B^j$ and $\phi_j, \psi_j$ are absolutely summable. For the time series $(Z_t)$ such that $E|Z_t| < \infty$ define $X_t = \Psi(B) \Phi(B) Z_t$.

Use the lemma 
%\ref
to see everything is well defined. 

$X_t = \sum_k \psi_k \sum_j \phi_j Z_{z-k-j} = \sum_{k,j} \psi_k \phi_j Z_{t-k-j}$

($k+j = l, j = l-k$)

$= \sum_l Z_{t+l} \sum_k \psi_k \phi_{l-k}$

($\sum_k \psi_k \phi_{l-k} = \theta_l$)

$= \Psi(B) 
%\composed 
\Phi(B) = \sum_l \theta_l B^l$

It follows that 
$\Psi(B) 
%\composed 
\Phi(B) = \Phi(B)
% \composed 
\Psi(B)$


\section{On practical time series analysis}
\vskip1cm


If we cannot assume stationarity we will assume that we study time series of the following form:

$X_t = m_t + S_t + Y_t$, where 

the {\bf trend} $m_t$ is a deterministic (hence the small letter) sequence, which "does not vary too much",

the {\bf seasonality} $s_t$ a deterministic sequence of known period $d$, such that $s_t = s_{t+d}$ for all $t$

and the $Y_t$ a (weakly/strongly) stationary time series.


\begin{observation}
In practise it is hard to distinguish the three components. 

Global warming: trend or seasonality? Here it is proven, but it can be hard to determine.
\end{observation}

But how do you do it, if you have to?

Practical time series analysis (t.s.a.) can be split into several steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item plot the observations $x_t$. We want to detect possible trend and seasonality. 
\item try to remove the trend and seasonality
\item residuals $y_t = x_t - \hat{m}_t - \hat{s}_t$ or $y_t = \log{x_t / x_{t-1}}$ are than modelled  by a stationary model
\begin{enumerate}
\item choose a model (AR, AM, ARCH, $\dots$, ARMA)
\item estimate parameters
\item check goodnes of fit
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
After that we can try to predict or simulate future behavior of the time series.

Use Ocham's razor.

Box (person): All models are wrong. Some are usefull.

Einstain: Make the model as simple as possible, but not simpler than that.

\subsection{Decomposing time series}

\vskip1cm


Assume $X_t = m_t + s_t + Y_t$, $Y_t$ a weakly stationary sequence, $s_t = s_{t+d}$ and $\sum_{t=1}^d S_t = 0$ (otherwise we can substract the mean in $m_t$) and $E Y_t = 0$ (similar as before). 

Assume (for start) there is no seasonality. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item We can remove the trend by differencing. We have seen that if $m_t = \sum_{j=0}^ka_j t^j$ is polinomial and we apply $\nabla^k$ we get
$X_t = k! a_k \nabla^k Y_t$. Because $Y_t$ is stationary $X_t$ is stationary by lemma
%\ref
.
\item Direct estimation of the trend. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item smoothing. Take $q < n \in N$ ("not too small"). We can set $\hat{m}_t = 1 / (2q + 1)\sum_{j = -q}^q X_{t+j}$, which is a linear filter. 

$\hat{m}_t = 1 / (2q + 1)\sum_{j = -q}^q m_{t+j}+ 1 / (2q + 1)\sum_{j = -q}^q Y_{t+j}$.

$1 / (2q + 1)\sum_{j = -q}^q Y_{t+j} = (approx) 0$ by law of large numbers??

If $m_t$ does not vary too much it is picewise linear and we can model it this way and it will be approximately true.

But this aproach does not work on the edge of the time series. 

\item exponential smoothing. Take $\alpha \in (0,1)$. $\hat{m}_1 = X_1$. $\hat{m}_t = \alpha X_t + (1 - \alpha) m_{t-1} =
\sum_{j = 0}^{k-2} \alpha(1-\alpha) X_{t-j} + (1-\alpha)^{t-1} X_j$.

\item fitting a functin to $m_t$, e.g. polynomial

$\hat{m}_t  =\sum_{j = 0}^k \hat{a}_jt^j$ and we choose $\hat{a}_k$ by OLS (najmanj≈°i kvadrati).
\end{enumerate}
 \item Remove seasonality and the trend by differencing. Define operator $\nabla_d = X_t = X_t - X_{t -d} = (I - B^d)X_t$.
If $s_t = s_{t+d}$ then $\nabla_d X_t = m_t - m_{t-d} + s_t - s_{t-d}+=  Y_t - Y_{t-d}$, but the $ s_t - s_{t-d} = 0$, so we come back to the previous examples.

\item Direct estimation of trend and seasonality (can be done in many ways, we show one).
\begin{enumerate}
\item def $q = d/2$ if $d$ even, $(d-1) / 2$ if $d$ odd. The initial estimate of the trend is choosen by smoothing:

$d = 2q$, $\hat{w}_t = \frac{1}{2d}X_{t-q} + \frac{1}{d} X_{t-q+1} + \frac{1}{d}X_{t+q-1} + \frac{1}{2d}X_{t+q}$.

Here we are trying to estimate the trend. Say we have monthly data and $q = 12$. We estimate by averaging over one year. But the edge months would be counted twice (previous year, next year), so we only take half od that. 

\item Transform data by removing the initial estimation of the trend: $X_t \rightarrow X_t - \hat{w}_t$.
Now we also estimate the seasonality. Initially we set $\hat{u}_k = \frac{1}{ \lfloor\frac{n-k}{d}\rfloor + 1 } \sum_{j=0}^{\lfloor\frac{n-k}{d}\rfloor} (x_{j+k} - \hat{w}_{j+d+k}), k=1,\dots, d$

$\hat{s}_k = \hat{u}_k - 1/d \sum_{j=1}^d \hat{u}_j, k=1, \dots, d, \hat{s}_t = \hat{s}_{t-d}$ 

\item we transform $X_t \rightarrow X_t - \hat{s}_t = d_t$. For $d_t$ we estimate trend by one of the methods above. 

\end{enumerate}  
\end{enumerate}


R has many (special) procedures to compute these estimates (use as a black box).
